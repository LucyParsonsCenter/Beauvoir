	  <h1>Hi @shopping_cart.shipping_name!</h1>
	  <p>
	    This is just to let you know that we have received your online order, and we should be processing it soon.
	    Please note that orders placed on Monday may be delayed, since the store is always closed on Mondays.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    If you have indicated that you'd like your order delivered via bicycle courier, we may be trying to get in touch with you via this email in the near future if we don't have enough information to make a successful delivery.  If there's another way (e.g. a phone #) we should contact you today, please let us know!   
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    We do our best to make sure that everything listed as in stock on our website is available immediately to ship from or be picked up at the store, but in the event there is a discrepancy in our inventory which will delay your order, we will be sure to be in touch.  If you've ordered something for pickup at the store, we will make sure to send you a mail when your order is ready and waiting for you behind our books counter.

#Borges at the LPC!

This is a Rails app that we used to manage book sales at the Lucy Parsons
Center. It's a fork of [Borges](https://github.com/johm/borges) by John
Duda.

##Installing and running it

If you want to do some dev work, check out [the
guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md). If you're interested in deploying the app
then the Vagrantfile here is a good guide. There's some handy stuff in the
[borges-utils](https://github.com/aliceriot/borges-utils) repo as well.

##License stuff

This code is forked from some GPL'ed code, so it's GPL'ed as well.

#Beauvoir

[![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/projects/54c8a533-53a9-41c9-a216-cbfefeea074d/595906/badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/alice-pote/beauvoir)

Beauvoir is a point of sale system written in Rails. It was built mainly
for use at the Lucy Parsons Center in Boston, MA and, as such, is mainly
designed to accomodate book sales, with provisions for a library as well.
It provides an admin interface and an API which
[Simone](https://github.com/LucyParsonsCenter/Simone) talks to.

Beauvoir is a fork of [Borges](https://github.com/johm/borges) (get it?)
by John Duda, with a lot of modification.

##Installing and running it

If you want to do some dev work, check out [the
guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) and the ever-growing [TODO](docs/TODO.md). If
you're interested in deploying the app then the Vagrantfile here is a good
guide. There's some handy stuff in the
[beauvoir-utils](https://github.com/aliceriot/beauvoir-utils) repo as
well.

The app runs on Ruby 2.2.3 and Rails 4.2.

##License stuff

This code is forked from some GPL'ed code, so it's GPL'ed as well.

#Beauvoir

Beauvoir is a point of sale system written in Rails. It was built mainly
for use at the Lucy Parsons Center in Boston, MA. 

Beauvoir is a fork of [Borges](https://github.com/johm/borges) (get it?)
by John Duda, with a lot of modification.

##Installing and running it

If you want to do some dev work, check out [the
guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md). If you're interested in deploying the app
then the Vagrantfile here is a good guide. There's some handy stuff in the
[beauvoir-utils](https://github.com/aliceriot/beauvoir-utils) repo as
well.

The app runs on Ruby 2.1 and Rails 4.2.

##License stuff

This code is forked from some GPL'ed code, so it's GPL'ed as well.
